					<h2>Why 360?</h2>
					<p>Large e-commerce retailers have been using 360° photography for years to allow their customers to more completely experience products before they purchase.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"... products with a 360-degree spin feature have conversion rate at least 10% higher and sometimes as much as 30-40% higher than products without it."</p>
						<p class="quote-author"> -Internet Retailer Magazine</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>360° photography has also been shown to reduce returns and lower customer service requests by helping customers educate themselves before purchasing.</p>

					<h2>Why now?</h2>
					<p>Most equipment currently used to make 360° photography costs anywhere from $2,000-$5,000. These complex proprietary systems are difficult to setup and use. Studios that offer 360° photography services typically charge anywhere from $150-$250 per product shot.</p>
					<p>We leveraged our deep expertise in computer vision to create Arqspin, a much simpler and less expensive way to make 360° photography. All you need is a smartphone and a way to rotate the object you want to spin (anything from a lazy susan to a motorized turntable will work). Now, you can showcase your products like the largest e-commerce merchants in the world.</p>
